I am currently a senior researcher at [Tencent ARC Lab](https://arc.tencent.com/en/index), working on 3D Generative AI. I obtained my Ph.D degree at ShanghaiTech University in 2024, advised by Prof. [Shenghua Gao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fe-1v0MAAAAJ). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2019.

From 2022 to 2024, I was a research intern at Tencent, working closely with [Xintao Wang](https://xinntao.github.io/) and [Yan-Pei Cao](https://yanpei.me/).

My research interests are 3D/4D reconstruction and generation, with the goal of providing high-fidelity 3D digitization and ready-to-use 3D contents.

If you are interested in research intern opportunities or collaborations, feel free to drop me an email.
